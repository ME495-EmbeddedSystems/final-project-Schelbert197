Here are the notes about gripper and working params that work with the two different expo marker types (fine tip and regular):

First home the gripper:
ros2 action send_goal /panda_gripper/homing franka_msgs/action/Homing "{}"

We are now using the Grasp Action which can be run from the terminal as follows:
ros2 action send_goal /panda_gripper/grasp franka_msgs/action/Grasp "{width: 0.012, speed: 0.05, force: 50.0}"

Params for each pen:
Fine tip:
- width: 0.009
- speed: 0.05
- force: 50.0
Regular tip:
- width: 0.012
- speed: 0.05
- force: 50.0

These widths have been tested on the frankas and SHOULD work.
