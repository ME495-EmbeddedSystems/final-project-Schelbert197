# ME495 Embedded Systems Final Project
Authors: Abhishek Sankar, Ananaya Agarwal, Graham Clifford, Ishani Narwankar, Srikanth Schelbert

**Rules for main**
1. Try to make your own feature branches until we are ready to merge
2. Pushing to main should be coordinated and infrequent.
3. Tasks and progress should be tracked through notion (link TBD)
4. Get excied for the final project!
5. Note: This will become a real README file as we get closer to project completion.
